# Faculty of Physical Sciences — UDS Nyankpala (Static Site)

This is a simple static scaffold for the Faculty of Physical Sciences website. It includes basic pages, responsive styles, and placeholder images/content you can replace.

Files created:
- `index.html` — Homepage
- `about.html`, `departments.html`, `staff.html`, `admissions.html`, `news.html`, `contact.html` — content pages
- `css/style.css` — styles
- `js/main.js` — minimal interactivity
- `images/` — placeholder images (add your own)

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Replace placeholder text and images in the `images/` folder with real assets (logo, staff photos).
3. For a working contact form, integrate a form handler (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or server endpoint.
4. To publish: push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy to Netlify/Vercel.

Notes & next steps:
- Add real logo and brand colors in `css/style.css`.
- Add staff profiles and a searchable directory if desired.
- Consider using a CMS (NetlifyCMS / WordPress) if you want non-technical editors to update news/events.
